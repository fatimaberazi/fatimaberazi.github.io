<h3>Welcome To My Website</h3>

<p>My name is Fatima Nasr. I am originally from Syria and due to the political situation, I had to relocate to Kurdistan where I am currently living with my family. As every new beginning, it was quite difficult to adapt. Leaving my home and my friends was a challenge, however I managed to overcome these difficulties and have found friends pretty quickly. In terms of living situation, my family and I are now living inside a camp. Again, something we all had to get used to. </p>
<p>My family and I are close, which is great,so we managed to turn this situation into something positive.
To manage my time effectively, I volunteered at working with the organization “Save the Children” which I found tremendously inspiring. After that, I also completed an apprenticeship with a Hotel, where I was able to use my skillset on how to deal with different people and learn how to work in time pressure environments. It also enabled me to improve my English language skills. Whilst I had to overcome a number of challenging situations, it also helped me in many ways. I am very grateful that I can continue studying in Kurdistan and can focus on learning and developing further.
I heard about Re:coded from an organization inside the refugee camp and was interested immediately. Re:coded is something I value highly. It’s a great thing to learn the English language with Programming language at the same time. I am someone who loves learning and discovering  new things. When I started learning coding I was so happy because it’s so useful and professional. Upon completion, I hope to utilize my skillset and be able to add value to a great team as well as company.
After Recoded, I plan to keep learning programming and learn new coding languages. There are professional and amazing teachers for English and programming languages. My English language before Re:coded was average, but after I joined I became able to speak well in front of anyone. It was a really amazing opportunity for me.
I would like to keep practicing and learning new things. I hope to study programming at the local university. I want develop new technology because technology is the most important thing in our world.
