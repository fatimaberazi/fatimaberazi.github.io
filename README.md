****One paragraph about your life before Re:Coded.***

My name is Fatima Nasr. I am originally from Syria, but now I am a refugee in Kurdistan, where I live with my family. I started my life here in a difficult way because it was hard to leave my country and live inside the camp.  But after a period of time, I became able to live well here and I have many friends. I also had a job with Save The Children Organization, which was an amazing experience working with children. 

After my work with Save The Children, I completed training Hotel Reception where I communicated with people from different backgrounds and cultures. This was an excellent experience to learn about dealing with different people, and improving my English.

The best thing that happened for me was being able to complete my studies here in Kurdistan. Studying was difficult in Syria because the situation was bad.  I am so grateful for this. 

******One paragraph about why you joined Re:Coded.***********

 I heard about Re:coded from an organization inside the refugee camp and I was so interested. Re:coded became like a dream for me. It’s a great thing to learn English language with Programming language at the same time. I am someone who loves to learn and discover new things. When I started learning coding I was so happy because it’s so useful and professional. I believed this program with help me increase my success in my career.
******One paragraph about what you want to do after Re:Coded.*********
What your dreams are, both immediately and long-term.

After Recoded, I plan to keep learning programming and learn new coding languages. There were  professional and amazing teachers for English and programming languages. My English language before Re:coded was average, but after I joined I became able to speak well in front of anyone. It was a really amazing opportunity for me.

I will  keep practicing and learning new things. I hope to study programming in the local university. I want develop new technology because technology is the most important thing in our world.  

My long-term dream is to teach children around the world what I learned because it’s so helpful. If someone can learn programming from childhood, it is better for their future.
